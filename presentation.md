##Things to Work On

###Real-World Code

- a script to do something useful (or not)

- a new gem

- a project you've already started

- refactoring some existing code

###Simple Programming Problems

There are some advantages of working on a simple programming problem instead of working on "real world" code (simplicity, "purity", likelihood of success). Feel free to try any of these:

- a simple calculator that takes two numbers and outputs their sum
- a simple calculator that takes any number of numbers and outputs their sum
- (as above, but without using Enumerable#inject)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
- [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com)
- [Code Kata](http://codekata.com)
- [Ruby Programming Challenge for Newbies](http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org)
- [14 Ways To Have Fun Coding Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/09/22/14-ways-to-have-fun-coding-ruby/)

##Pair Programming Styles

Ping Pong: Person A writes a failing test, Person B makes the test pass and writes another failing test, hands back to Person A to make that test pass and write another test, ad infinitum.

Driver-Navigator: Person A has control and writes some tests and the code to make them pass. Person B observes and makes helpful comments and suggestions when appropriate. At some stage, Person A hands control over to Person B.

Decide with your pair which style you would like to use beforehand. Don't be afraid to suggest trying another style if you're not comfortable with the one you are using, or if you think it's not going anywhere.

If all else fails and you think it's not really working with your pair, please let us know and we'll try to match you with another group.

##Pairing Etiquette

- The Golden Rule: "Do unto your pair as you would have them do unto you"
- don't hog the keyboard
- when it's your turn, remember that no-one can read your mind (it's often helpful to describe what you're doing to your pair, even if it might be obvious)
- when it's your pair's turn, give them time and let them work at their own pace (don't grab the keyboard; sit on your hands if you need to)
- remember you're part of a pair - please don't work on the code when your pair is not around (e.g., taking a break)
- take small steps and write just enough code to let the tests pass (no voodoo!)
- have a shower and avoid a garlicky breakfast before the session :)
