#Ruby Pair Programming

Want to level-up your Ruby [dev chops](http://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-phrase-dev-chops-make-me-think-of-cannibalism)?

Miss the social interactions of being in a team? Would you like to [improve your communication skills](http://images.sussexpublishers.netdna-cdn.com/article-top/blogs/84326/2012/04/93794-91127.jpg)?

Tired of [working on a problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle) and getting nowhere? Is your [rubber duck](http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/products/rubberduck) fed up of listening to you?

Or are you just curious about Ruby and want to learn more about this great language from Real Ruby Devs?

Then Ruby Pair Programming might just be the thing you need!

##What is Pair Programming?
From Wikipedia: "Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other...reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently."

##About the Ruby Pair Programming Session
- The objective of this session is to learn during the process. Don't fret if at the end of the day you find that you haven't achieved anything "productive"
- Different people will use different tools (editors, test frameworks, etc). You might be unfamiliar with your pair's setup, but take this as a chance to learn something new. Maybe you will like what you see!
- Ruby, Ruby, Ruby - we'll allow you to use other technologies, e.g., Javascript :) but please focus on using Ruby as the primary language
- Ruby doesn't just mean Rails. Feel free to work on a script, start a gem, hack on a Sinatra app, etc
- Use Test Driven Development if you can (or at least have tests in place). Despite what some people think, we've found that TDD works well in most circumstances
- Pair programming doesn't strictly have to be pairs. If n.modulo(2).zero? we can have a triplet group

##What to Bring

Your laptop with Ruby and a test framework installed (Minitest comes with Ruby; many Ruby devs prefer RSpec). Your favourite editor. An open mind.

If you don't know where to start, don't worry. We can help you install Ruby and set up your laptop at the session.

We'll provide power, desks, air-conditioning and WiFi. And hopefully an enjoyable morning of coding.

##Programme

After an introduction to the session, we'll help set up the pairings and leave you to it. At the end of the session, we'll have a huddle and perhaps discuss what we learned.

##Things to Work On

###Real-World Code

- a script to do something useful (or not)

- a new gem

- a project you've already started

- refactoring some existing code

###Simple Programming Problems

There are some advantages of working on a simple programming problem instead of working on "real world" code (e.g., simplicity, "purity", likelihood of success). Feel free to try any of these:

- a simple calculator that takes two numbers and outputs their sum
- a simple calculator that takes any number of numbers and outputs their sum
- (as above, but without using Enumerable#inject)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
- [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com)
- [Code Kata](http://codekata.com)
- [Ruby Programming Challenge for Newbies](http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org)
- [14 Ways To Have Fun Coding Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/09/22/14-ways-to-have-fun-coding-ruby/)

##[Pair Programming Styles](http://articles.coreyhaines.com/posts/thoughts-on-pair-programming/)

Ping Pong: Person A writes a failing test, Person B makes the test pass and writes another failing test, hands back to Person A to make that test pass and write another test, ad infinitum.

Driver-Navigator: Person A has control and writes the tests and the code to make them pass. Person B observes and makes helpful comments and suggestions when appropriate. At some stage, Person A hands control over to Person B.

Decide with your pair which style you would like to use beforehand. Don't be afraid to suggest trying another style if you're not comfortable with the one you are using, or if you think it's not going anywhere.

If all else fails and you think it's not really working with your pair, please let us know and we'll try to match you with another group.

##The Golden Rule of Pairing

"Do unto your pair as you would have them do unto you"

##Pairing Etiquette

- don't hog the keyboard
- when it's your turn, remember that no-one can read your mind (it's often helpful to describe what you're doing to your pair, even if it might be obvious)
- when it's your pair's turn, give them time and let them work at their own pace (don't grab the keyboard; sit on your hands if you need to)
- take small steps and write just enough code to let the tests pass
- you're part of a pair - you are not allowed to work on the code when your pair is not around (e.g., taking a break)
- have a shower and avoid a garlicky breakfast before the session :)
